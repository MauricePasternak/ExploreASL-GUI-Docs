# Exporting Plot and Images

---

Finally, it may be easily missable that there is an option in the lower right corner of the plot, `Export Figure To PNG`, which will allow you to save the plot and the MRI views as a single figure in a PNG file.

![Export Figure To PNG](../../assets/img/Tutorial/DataViz/8_Exporting/DataViz_Plot_ExportPage.png)

A file dialog will open to allow you to specify the location and name of the file, where it will then be saved.
