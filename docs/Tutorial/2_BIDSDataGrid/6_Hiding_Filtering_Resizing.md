# Hiding, Filtering, and Resizing

--- 

A few additional features are available for the spreadsheet, which are accessible through the spreadsheet's toolbar. These include:

## Hiding Columns

The visibility of columns (other than ID and Filename) can be toggled on and off through the popover window that appears when you click on the `Columns` button in the toolbar.

## Filtering Rows

Which rows to display on the basis of their value for a particular field can be toggled on and off through the popover window that appears when you click on the `Filters` button in the toolbar.

## Changing Row Size

Finally, the overall compactness of rows can be adjusted through the popover window that appears when you click on the `Density` button in the toolbar. This is useful if you have a large number of rows and want to make the spreadsheet more compact.
