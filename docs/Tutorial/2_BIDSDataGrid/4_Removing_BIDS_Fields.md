# Removing BIDS Fields

---

Like Excel, the spreadsheet allows you to remove columns from the spreadsheet. Click on the `Remove Column` button located in the spreadsheet's toolbar.

This will open a modal window that will prompt you to select the field(s) to be removed from the spreadsheet.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will make the mistake of removing all the fields.

After acknowleding the warning and pressing `Remove from Spreadsheet`, the fields will be removed:

Of course, in a real-world scenario, you would never want to remove all the fields from the spreadsheet. This is just to demonstrate the functionality of the spreadsheet. In the next section we will undo this mistake.
